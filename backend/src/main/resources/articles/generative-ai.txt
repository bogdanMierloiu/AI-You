While various applications of AI have come on the scene, generative AI technology is the darling transforming humans’ lives at the moment.

“Regular” AI (also known as discriminative) is focused on distinguishing between types of informational input.

Generative AI sounds like a creative form of AI, and it’s that in spades. It mimics human creativity, coming up with high-quality generated content (supposedly material that hasn’t existed, but that, practically, could amount to rephrased or repurposed information) — text, images, answers to questions, videos, songs, report summaries, diagrams, poems, marketing copy, webinars, essays, computer code, and you name it.
